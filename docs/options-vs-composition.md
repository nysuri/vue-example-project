# Options API vs Composition API

## Options API

- The traditional Vue approach
- Organizes code by options (data, methods, computed, etc.)
- Easier for beginners to understand separation of concerns
- Can become harder to maintain in large components 

## Composition API

- Introduced in Vue 3
- Organizes code by logical concerns
- Uses **setup** and reactive references
- Better TypeScript support
- More flexible code organization
- Easer code reuse

### Example Comparison

**Options API**

```vue
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

**Composition API**

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

function increment() {
  count.value++
}

onMounted(() => {
  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)
})
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

## Which to choose?

You can choose whichever you like. However, for this workshop, we'll use the Composition API as it's the more modern approach and offers better scalability.
