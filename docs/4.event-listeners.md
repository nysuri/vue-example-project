# Event Listeners

We can listen to DOM events using the `v-on` directive:

```vue
function increment() { 
    // update component state 
} 

{% raw %}
<button v-on:click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
{% endraw %}
```

Due to its frequent use, v-on also has a shorthand syntax:

```vue
{% raw %}
<button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
{% endraw %}
```

Like the attributes, there are many more event listeners (@mouseover, @scroll, @submit, etc...)

<hr style="max-width:24rem; margin-top:2rem"/>

### Exercise

A book has also a `read` property, which indicates that a book is read or not (boolean). Let's create a function that toggles this property:

```vue
function toggleRead(id) {
  const foundBook = books.value.find((book) => book.id === id)

  if (foundBook) {
    foundBook.read = !foundBook.read
  }
}
```

Now add a click handler to the button:

```vue
<button class="read-button" v-on:click="toggleRead(books[0].id)">Mark as read</button>
```

After each toggle, we want the UI to reflect the changes. If a book is marked as 'read', its title should be struck through to indicate that we've read it. In the previous chapter, we learned how to bind attributes to elements. Now, we'll add the 'read' class when a book is marked as read.

{% raw %}
```vue
<p class="book-title" :class="{ read: books[0].read }">{{ books[0].title }}</p>
```
{% endraw %}

Try clicking on the toggle button.


## Next Chapter

In the next chapter, we'll display all the books dynamically.
