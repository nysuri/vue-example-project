# Event Listeners

We can listen to DOM events using the `v-on` directive:

{% raw %}
```vue
function increment(event) {
    // do something with the event object if needed. 
    // update component state 
} 


<button v-on:click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
```
{% endraw %}

Due to its frequent use, v-on also has a shorthand syntax:

{% raw %}
```vue
<button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
```
{% endraw %}

Like the attributes, there are many more event listeners (@mouseover, @scroll, @submit, etc...)

<hr style="max-width:24rem; margin-top:2rem"/>

### Exercise

1. A book has a `read` property, which indicates that a book is read or not (boolean). Let's create a function that toggles this property. Copy the logic below to the `toggleRead()` function.

```vue
function toggleRead(id) {
  const foundBook = books.value.find((book) => book.id === id)

  if (foundBook) {
    foundBook.read = !foundBook.read
  }
}
```

Now add a click handler to the button:

{% raw %}
```vue
<button class="read-button" @click="toggleRead(books[0].id)">Mark as read</button>
```
{% endraw %}

The button now toggles the `read` property of the book, but we need visual feedback: strikethrough the title when a book is marked as read. Like the following:

// TOOD: video of marking and unmarking a book.

There is already styling provided le in the <style> block (`.read`). 


In the previous chapter, we learned how to bind attributes to elements. Now, we'll add the 'read' class when a book is marked as read.



{% raw %}
```vue
<p class="book-title" :class="{ read: books[0].read }">{{ books[0].title }}</p>
```
{% endraw %}

Try clicking on the toggle button.

2. Add an click event listener to the `delete` button. Bind it with deleteBook() function and give the id of the first book as parameter in the function: `deleteBook(books[0].id)`.

## Next Chapter

In the next chapter, we'll display all the books dynamically.
