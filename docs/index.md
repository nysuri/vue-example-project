# Workshop VueJS

## Introduction

Welcome to the Vue tutorial!

The goal of this tutorial is to quickly give you an experience of what it feels like to work with Vue. We'll build a simple library management application using Vue 3. By the end, you'll have a working app that can:

- Display a list of books
- Add new books
- Delete books
- Apply conditional styling
- Demonstrate core Vue concepts

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.
Before starting, make sure you have:

1. NodeJS installed (LTS)
2. The starter app cloned from Gitlab: (todo: provide link)

## Workshop Structure

We'll cover Vue's core concepts progressively as we build our app. Each section explains a concent, shows how to use it, and includes excercises.

## Let's Get Started!

First, let's understand the difference between Options API and Composition API
