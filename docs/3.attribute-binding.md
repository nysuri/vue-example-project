# Attribute Bindings

In Vue, mustaches are only used for text interpolation. To bind an attribute to a dynamic value, we use the v-bind directive:

```vue
<div v-bind:id="dynamicId"></div>
```

A **directive** is a special attribute that starts with the v- prefix. They are part of Vue's template syntax. Similar to text interpolations, directive values are JavaScript expressions that have access to the component's state.

The part after the colon (==:id==) is the "argument" of the directive. Here, the element's id attribute will be synced with the dynamicId property from the component's state.

Because v-bind is used so frequently, it has a dedicated shorthand syntax:

```vue
<div :id="dynamicId"></div>
```

Note: id is not the only thing we can bind to html-elements. There are many more like class, style, value, href, src, and event handlers such as onclick, onmouseover, etc.

For example:

```vue
<div class="static" :class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"></div>
```

You can have both the static as well as the dynamic attribute bind to the element (class & :class).

### In our library app

Every book has a unique identifier (`id`).
Let's make the id of the list unique. Change the following line `<li id="1" class="book-item">` to: `<li :id="books[0].id" class="book-item">`

Neat! Although we don't see anything happening yet, we need the id for things like toggling classes and deleting the book.

<hr style="max-width:24rem; margin-top:2rem"/>

## Next Chapter

Let's see how we can use this id in the next chapter.

<a href="./4.event-listeners" style="display: inline-flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; padding: 6px 12px; background-color: #3b82f6; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 500; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; transition: all 0.2s ease; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
